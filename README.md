## How it works

Picture it Editor was not built to run the model locally on your machine, this is because running models is not the focus of this project, the focus really is on the user experience, to create a great editor for better working with AI Art.

Instead, Picture it uses [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) as the API to run the models, the advantage of that is that the editor is able to use many models at the same time with no setup or the need of a powerful GPU, and as they evolve, no effort from the user is required to update them.

## Running Locally

First, you are going to need a Replicate API key, to be able to use the AI models, get one at:

https://replicate.com/

Then, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/rogeriochaves/pictureit-editor
npm install
```

Now start the project, passing your token as ENV:

```
VITE_ENV_BACKEND=replicate VITE_ENV_REPLICATE_TOKEN=<token> npm run dev
```

App should be running. Go to http://localhost:5173/ and enjoy!
